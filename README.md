Traffic accident analysis — road/weather/time hotspots, Public



🚗 Traffic Accident Data Analysis

🎯 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of traffic accidents, completed as part of a data analyst internship at SkillCraft Technology. The core objective was to identify and visualize the key patterns and contributing factors behind traffic accidents. The analysis focuses on how road conditions, weather, and time of day correlate with accident frequency, culminating in clear and actionable insights.

📁 Dataset & Tools
The analysis is based on the accidents.csv dataset. I utilized Google Colab as the primary development environment, leveraging its cloud-based resources.

The following Python libraries were key to this project:

Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data cleaning, manipulation, and numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating high-quality static visualizations.
Folium: For generating an interactive map to pinpoint accident hotspots.


📈 Key Findings & Visualizations
The analysis uncovered several significant patterns, which are illustrated through key visualizations in the notebook:
Temporal Trends: A time-series plot revealing accident frequency by the hour of the day, highlighting peak accident times.
Environmental Impact: Bar charts and heatmaps that demonstrate the relationship between accidents and different weather and road conditions.
Geospatial Hotspots: An interactive map of the region, clearly marking high-density accident locations.
Contributing Factors: Charts breaking down the most common contributing factors, offering a deeper understanding of accident causes.

🚀 How to Run the Project
To view and run this analysis:
Open the Notebook: Navigate to the 01_data_prep.ipynb file in your Google Colab environment.
Upload the Dataset: Ensure the accidents.csv file is uploaded to your Colab session.
Run All Cells: Execute all the cells sequentially to see the data processing, analysis, and visualizations in action.
